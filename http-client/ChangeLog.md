# Changelog for http-client

## 0.7.12

* Fix premature connection closing due to weak reference lifetimes [#490](https://github.com/snoyberg/http-client/pull/490)

## 0.7.11

* Allow making requests to raw IPv6 hosts [#477](https://github.com/snoyberg/http-client/pull/477)
* Catch "resource vanished" exception on initial response read [#480](https://github.com/snoyberg/http-client/pull/480)
* Search for reachable IP addresses asynchronously (RFC 6555, 8305) after calling `getAddrInfo` to reduce latency [#472](https://github.com/snoyberg/http-client/pull/472).

## 0.7.10

* Consume trailers and last CRLF of chunked body. The trailers are not exposed,
  unless the raw body is requested.

## 0.7.9

* Exceptions from streamed request body now cause the request to fail. Previously they were
  routed through onRequestBodyException and, by default, the IOExceptions were discarded.

## 0.7.8

* Include the original `Request` in the `Response`. Expose it via `getOriginalRequest`.

## 0.7.7

* Allow secure cookies for localhost without HTTPS [#460](https://github.com/snoyberg/http-client/pull/460)

## 0.7.6

* Add `applyBearerAuth` function [#457](https://github.com/snoyberg/http-client/pull/457/files)

## 0.7.5

* Force closing connections in case of exceptions throwing [#454](https://github.com/snoyberg/http-client/pull/454).

## 0.7.4

* Depend on base64-bytestring instead of memory [#453](https://github.com/snoyberg/http-client/pull/453)

## 0.7.3

* Added `withSocket` to `Network.HTTP.Client.Connection`.

## 0.7.2.1

* Fix bug in `useProxySecureWithoutConnect`.

## 0.7.2

* Add a new proxy mode, proxySecureWithoutConnect, for sending HTTPS requests in plain text to a proxy without using the CONNECT method.

## 0.7.1

* Remove `AI_ADDRCONFIG` [#400](https://github.com/snoyberg/http-client/issues/400)

## 0.7.0

* Remove Eq instances for Cookie, CookieJar, Response, Ord instance for Cookie [#435](https://github.com/snoyberg/http-client/pull/435)

## 0.6.4.1

* Win32 2.8 support [#430](https://github.com/snoyberg/http-client/pull/430)

## 0.6.4

* Avoid throwing an exception when a malformed HTTP header is received,
  to be as robust as commonly used HTTP clients.
  See [#398](https://github.com/snoyberg/http-client/issues/398)

## 0.6.3

* Detect response body termination before reading an extra null chunk
  when possible. This allows connections to be reused in some corner
  cases. See
  [#395](https://github.com/snoyberg/http-client/issues/395)

## 0.6.2

* Add `shouldStripHeaderOnRedirect` option to `Request` [#300](https://github.com/snoyberg/http-client/issues/300)

## 0.6.1.1

* Ensure that `Int` parsing doesn't overflow [#383](https://github.com/snoyberg/http-client/issues/383)

## 0.6.1

* Add `setUriEither` to `Network.HTTP.Client.Internal`

## 0.6.0

* Generalize `renderParts` over arbitrary applicative functors.  One particular
  use case that is enabled by this change is that now `renderParts` can be used
  in pure code by using it in combination with `runIdentity`.

## 0.5.14

* Omit port for `getUri` when protocol is `http` and port is `80`, or when
  protocol is `https` and port is `443`
* Sending requests with invalid headers now throws InvalidRequestHeader exception

## 0.5.13.1
