-- | This is the main entry point for using http-client. Used by itself, this
-- module provides low-level access for streaming request and response bodies,
-- and only non-secure HTTP connections. Helper packages such as http-conduit
-- provided higher level streaming approaches, while other helper packages like
-- http-client-tls provide secure connections.
--
-- There are three core components to be understood here: requests, responses,
-- and managers. A @Manager@ keeps track of open connections to various hosts,
-- and when requested, will provide either an existing open connection or
-- create a new connection on demand. A @Manager@ also automatically reaps
-- connections which have been unused for a certain period of time. A @Manager@
-- allows for more efficient HTTP usage by allowing for keep-alive connections.
-- Secure HTTP connections can be allowed by modifying the settings used for
-- creating a manager. The simplest way to create a @Manager@ is with:
--
-- @
-- 'newManager' 'defaultManagerSettings'
-- @
--
-- or using the 'bracket' pattern with
--
-- @
-- 'withManager' 'defaultManagerSettings'
-- @
--
-- The next core component is a @Request@, which represents a single HTTP
-- request to be sent to a specific server. @Request@s allow for many settings
-- to control exact how they function, but usually the simplest approach for
-- creating a @Request@ is to use 'parseUrl'.
--
-- Finally, a @Response@ is the result of sending a single @Request@ to a
-- server, over a connection which was acquired from a @Manager@. Note that you
-- must close the response when you're done with it to ensure that the
-- connection is recycled to the @Manager@ to either be used by another
-- request, or to be reaped. Usage of @withResponse@ will ensure that this
-- happens automatically.
--
-- Helper packages may provide replacements for various recommendations listed
-- above. For example, if using http-client-tls, instead of using
-- 'defaultManagerSettings', you would want to use @tlsManagerSettings@. Be
-- sure to read the relevant helper library documentation for more information.
--
-- A note on exceptions: for the most part, all actions that perform I/O should
-- be assumed to throw an @HttpException@ in the event of some problem, and all
-- pure functions will be total. For example, @withResponse@, @httpLbs@, and
-- @BodyReader@ can all throw exceptions. Functions like @responseStatus@ and
-- @applyBasicAuth@ are guaranteed to be total (or there\'s a bug in the
-- library).
--
-- One thing to be cautioned about: the type of @parseUrl@ allows it to work in
-- different monads. If used in the @IO@ monad, it will throw an exception in
-- the case of an invalid URI. In addition, if you leverage the @IsString@
-- instance of the @Request@ value via @OverloadedStrings@, an invalid URI will
-- result in a partial value. Caveat emptor!
