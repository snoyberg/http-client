-- | Perform a @Request@ using a connection acquired from the given @Manager@,
-- and then provide the @Response@ to the given function. This function is
-- fully exception safe, guaranteeing that the response will be closed when the
-- inner function exits. It is defined as:
--
-- > withResponse req man f = bracket (responseOpen req man) responseClose f
--
-- It is recommended that you use this function in place of explicit calls to
-- 'responseOpen' and 'responseClose'.
--
-- You will need to use functions such as 'brRead' to consume the response
-- body.

-- Since 0.1.0

-- | A convenience wrapper around 'withResponse' which reads in the entire
-- response body and immediately closes the connection. Note that this function
-- performs fully strict I\/O, and only uses a lazy ByteString in its response
-- for memory efficiency. If you are anticipating a large response body, you
-- are encouraged to use 'withResponse' and 'brRead' instead.

-- | The most low-level function for initiating an HTTP request.
--
-- The first argument to this function gives a full specification
-- on the request: the host to connect to, whether to use SSL,
-- headers, etc. Please see 'Request' for full details.  The
-- second argument specifies which 'Manager' should be used.
--
-- This function then returns a 'Response' with a
-- 'BodyReader'.  The 'Response' contains the status code
-- and headers that were sent back to us, and the
-- 'BodyReader' contains the body of the request.  Note
-- that this 'BodyReader' allows you to have fully
-- interleaved IO actions during your HTTP download, making it
-- possible to download very large responses in constant memory.
--
-- An important note: the response body returned by this function represents a
-- live HTTP connection. As such, if you do not use the response body, an open
-- socket will be retained indefinitely. You must be certain to call
-- 'responseClose' on this response to free up resources.
--
-- This function automatically performs any necessary redirects, as specified
-- by the 'redirectCount' setting.
--
-- When implementing a (reverse) proxy using this function or relating
-- functions, it's wise to remove Transfer-Encoding:, Content-Length:,
-- Content-Encoding: and Accept-Encoding: from request and response
-- headers to be relayed.
